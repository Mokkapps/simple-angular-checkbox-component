# Simple Angular Checkbox Component

[(Unstyled) live demo](https://simple-angular-checkbox-component.netlify.com/)

This repository demonstrates a simple Angular checkbox component inspired by the [Angular Material Checkbox](https://github.com/angular/material2/tree/master/src/lib/checkbox) but without the dependency to any UI component library.

[Checkout the component code](https://github.com/Mokkapps/simple-angular-checkbox-component/tree/master/src/app/checkbox)

The motivation was to:

* implement a simple, usable Angular checkbox component
* based on good practices established by the Angular Material components (accessibility, tests, etc.)
* without any dependency to an existing UI component library
* usable without form, in template form and in reactive forms

Custom component styling was not considered in this example but it can easily be added in the `checkbox.component.scss` file.
