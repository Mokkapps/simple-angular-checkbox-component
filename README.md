# Simple Angular Checkbox Component

[(Ugly/unstyled) live demo](https://simple-angular-checkbox-component.netlify.com/)

This repository demonstrates a simple Angular checkbox component based on the [Angular Material Checkbox](https://github.com/angular/material2/tree/master/src/lib/checkbox).

The motivation was to:

* provide a simple, usable Angular checkbox component
* based on good practices established by the Angular Material components (accessibility, tests, etc.)
* usable without form, in template form and in reactive forms

Styling was not considered in this example but it can easily be added in the `checkbox.component.scss` file.
